<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi everyone! I'm Libby. I'm 27, and I'm a self taught, full stack, web developer. This site here is my HTML only site,
   no CSS or JavaScript.
</p>

<p>I love to read, watch movies, and listen to Taylor Swift. My favorite book is Divine Rivals by Rebecca Ross. I have a link
  to one of my first projects where I list out my favorite movies. And, my favorite Taylor Swift album is evermore!
</p>

<p>I hope to work as a web developer in the future, or in the publishing industry as a designer or someone who can help
  out in any capacity. I'm thinking of starting a blog and writing out my reviews of my favorite things.
